        <h1>Seeing the Solar System</h1>
        <p>Here is the night sky as you can see it with your own eyes
          under perfect conditions - say on a good night at the summit
          of Cerro Tololo in Chile.  Only the Moon is omitted, because
          it moves so fast compared to everything else you can see it
          would be just a blur, and because on the scale of the solar
          system you discover the Moon is part of the Earth.</p>
        <p><b>What are you looking at?  Can you prove it just from
          what you see in the sky?</b>  You will explore these
          questions here.</p>
        <p>Nearly everything you see in the sky is unchanging - it
          looks the same now as it did to the original builders of
          Stonehenge.  The Sun and planets (plus the Moon and, rarely,
          a comet) are the only things you can see in the sky that
          move perceptably relative to the stars.  How can you work
          out the shapes and relative sizes of the orbits of the
          planets?  Can different models describe what you see here,
          or is there only one possible explanation?</p>
        <p>Here you can explore planetary motion with each passing
          year compressed into a bit less than ten seconds.</p>
        <p>Caveats:
          <ul>
            <li>The solid blue line is the ecliptic plane; the dashed
              blue line is the equatorial plane.  Solid and dashed
              crosses are the corresponding poles.</li>
            <li>Unlike the dots that represent them here, the planets
              and stars have no discernable size to your naked eye -
              they are mere points of light as far as anyone can
              see.</li>
            <li>The disk of the Sun is actually about half the size
              shown here.</li>
            <li>Changes in brightness of the planets are not depicted.</li>
            <li>You can't see anything closer than 15 or 20 degrees
              (about the size of Orion) from the Sun - in other words
              within about an hour of sunset or sunrise.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Close this exposition using the x button at the upper

            How the Sun and Planets Move</a></h2>
        <p>The Sun and planets move through the constellations of the
          Zodiac.  The Sun moves exactly around a great circle in the
          sky called the ecliptic, which is the horizontal blue line.
          The planets execute a much more complicated motion, always
          remaining near the ecliptic.  The planets usually move
          around the Zodiac in the same west-to-east direction as the
          Sun, but occasionally reverse and move "retrograde" through
          the Zodiac from east to west.  (Note that when you look up
          at the sky instead of down at a map, east is to your left
          and west is to your right, when north is up!)</p>
        <p>You will want to "drag the sky" with your mouse to look
          around - otherwise you may need to wait a long time for
          slow-moving Jupiter and Saturn to come into view.  It's also
          fun to lok for your favorite constellations.  Orion and the
          Big Dipper are easy to find.  Cassiopeia and the Southern
          Cross are harder because they lie very near the dense star
          fields of the Milky Way.</p>
        <p>Notice that the planets naturally divide in two groups:
          Mercury and Venus always stay near the Sun, while Mars,
          Jupiter, and Saturn can appear anywhere on the ecliptic
          relative to the Sun.  Arranged by their greatest speed
          relative to the stars, from fastest to slowest the order is
          Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.  In what
          follows, we will consider only the Sun (obviously a special
          simpler case), Venus as a representative of the faster
          planets, and Mars as a representative of the slower
          planets.</p>
        <h2><a id="sun-section" href="#sun-section"
               onclick="setDialogTo('sun')">
            Sun's Motion Not Quite Uniform</a></h2>
        <p>While the motion of the Sun is far simpler than the
          planets, it is not as simple as it could be.  Although
          confined exactly to the ecliptic, the Sun speeds up and
          slows down slightly over the course of the year.  If you
          count the days from the March equinox to the December
          equinox you find there are 186, but from the December
          equinox back to the March equinox takes only 179 days - even
          though the equinoxes are exactly 180 degrees apart on the
          ecliptic.</p>
        <p>The only way you can see this tiny effect is to compare the
          actual position of the Sun to a point on the ecliptic called
          the "mean Sun" - an imaginary direction which moves around
          the ecliptic at an exactly uniform rate.  The mean Sun is at
          the same point as the actual Sun at perihelion, when Earth
          is closest to the Sun in early January, and at aphelion,
          when Earth is farthest from the Sun in early July.  We
          understand that the Earth moves around the Sun faster near
          perihelion, and slower near aphelion, but the concept of the
          mean Sun has been around since ancient times - long before
          its explanation in terms of the Earth's orbit was known.</p>
        <p>Note that the blue ecliptic and celestial equator lines
          were also well-known in ancient times.  Hence the equinoxes
          and the slight non-uniformity in the Sun's motion around the
          ecliptic were also known, probably since prehistoric times.</p>
        <p>Notice the Sun reaches its maximum westward position
          relative to the mean Sun just before reaching the brightest
          part of the Milky way, and its maximum eastward position
          just before passing over Orion, year after year.  Although
          the speed of the Sun varies, the pattern of those variations
          repeats exactly every year.</p>
        <h2><a id="venus-section" href="#venus-section"
               onclick="setDialogTo('venus')">
            How Venus Moves</a></h2>
        <p>Venus oscillates back and forth from about 48 degrees west
          of the Sun to 48 degrees east of the Sun, completing one
          cycle roughly every 584 days.  Unlike the motion of the Sun
          around the ecliptic, these cycles never repeat exactly -
          both the period and the path vary without any obvious
          pattern from one cycle to the next.  When west of the Sun,
          Venus is the morning star, when east of the Sun it is the
          evening star.  Its oscillations are not at all symmetrical:
          Venus slowly overtakes the Sun during its prograde motion
          passing from the morning to the evening side of the Sun,
          then quickly snaps back retrograde from the evening to the
          morning side.</p>
        <p>Ancient Egyptian and Babylonian astronomers pointed out
          that this motion looks very much as if Venus is moving
          around the Sun in the same direction as the Sun is moving
          around the ecliptic.  Our nearly edge-on view of this
          roughly circular motion makes Venus appear to oscillate from
          one side of the Sun to the other in this asymmetric way.
          This observation is undoubtedly the origin of the epicycle
          model of planetary motion worked out in detail by ancient
          Greek astronomers which held sway for nearly two millenia

            How Mars Moves</a></h2>
        <p>The motion of Mars is much harder to describe than the
          motion of Venus.  The connection to the Sun is much subtler:
          Mars is always in the middle of its retrograde motion when
          it is exactly opposite the Sun.  The anti-sun direction on
          the ecliptic is marked to help you notice this regularity.
          By turning to keep the Sun at the center of the view, you
          could watch Venus oscillate back and forth.  If you want to
          watch Mars in a similar way, you need to turn to keep an
          imaginary direction in space, labeled "sun-mars" for reasons
          to be described later, at the center of your view: Mars
          oscillates back and forth around this sun-mars direction in
          much the way Venus oscillates around the Sun direction.</p>
        <p>Once again, Mars slowly overtakes the sun-mars direction
          during the prograde part of its motion, then more quickly
          returns to the west side of the sun-mars direction in its
          retrograde part.  The sun-mars direction is constructed to
          align with Mars itself in the middle of its prograde part
          exactly when the Sun overtakes it (called conjunction), and
          again in the middle of its retrograde part exactly when it
          crosses the anti-sun direction (called opposition).  Be sure
          to watch for these moments when the Sun and anti-sun pass
          Mars.  One whole cycle takes 780 days on average, but is
          considerably more irregular than the 584 day Venus
          cycle.</p>
        <p>Although not depicted here, Mars is dramatically brighter
          near opposition than during the prograde part of its motion,
          a strong hint that it is much closer to us then.</p>
        <p>Oppositions are extremely important times to make careful
          observations of Mars (and Jupiter and Saturn), because they
          can be measured very accurately.  Conjuctions, when a planet
          passes either directly behind or (in the case of Venus and
          Mercury) directly in front of the Sun, would be just as
          important for understanding the motion, but can never be
          measured very accurately.  Since you can never see anything
          in the sky anywhere near the Sun, you can only estimate the
          exact time of a conjunction.  (Unless you have an
          essentially perfect theory of planetary motion!)</p>

            How to Model Planetary Motion</a></h2>
        <p>Most popular discussions of the history of solar system
          models concentrate on the shift from geocentric
          (Earth-centered) models to heliocentric (Sun-centered)
          models.  But the real breakthrough was made by Kepler in
          1609, and does not have much to do with whether you think
          the Sun or the Earth is at the center of the solar system.
          After all, the heliocentrism dates at least back to
          Aristarchus in the century before Hipparchus.  Hipparchus,
          the greatest astronomer of antiquity, carefully studied the
          idea, and judged that the mathematically equivalent
          geocentric model provided a simpler description of planetary
          motion.</p>
        <p>In fact, there is no way to define or establish which body,
          if any, in the solar system is at rest, no matter how
          carefully you measure the positions of planets.  The sense
          in which the Sun is the center of the solar system is a
          theoretical prediction of Newtonian mechanics (published in
          1687), which could not be observationally confirmed until
          centuries later (from stellar parallax).</p>
        <p>Ultimately, all orbits are simply imaginary lines - there
          are no railroad tracks in space.  The heliocentric orbits we
          all learn to draw in school are not the only reasonable
          choice for how to think about what you see in the sky.  In
          many ways, the older geocentric picture provides a more
          immediate description of how the planets move, so it's worth
          explaining the relationship between the model we learned and
          the ancient models.  If you want to master any subject, you
          need to be able to see it from as many perspectives as
          possible.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, what Kepler really did - one of the greatest
          scientific advances of all time - was figure out how to
          survey the shapes of the orbits of Mars and of Earth (or the
          Sun).  For millenia even the greatest astronomers had merely
          guessed shapes and compared their guesses to observations.
          Kepler was the first to actually measure the shapes of the
          orbits.  Before we get to that, let's take a look at the
          various different ways people have imagined planetary
          orbits.</p>
        <h3><a id="venus1-section" href="#venus1-section"
               onclick="setDialogTo('venus1')">
            Venus's orbit viewed from Earth</a></h3>
        <p>Since Venus appears to oscillate from the morning to the
          evening side of the Sun, ancient astronomers in Egypt and
          Babylon imagined that we had a nearly edge on view of an
          orbit around the Sun.  The asymmetry in the prograde and
          retrograde parts of this loop hints that Venus passes
          between the Earth and Sun on the retrograde part, and behind
          the Sun on the prograde part, moving arond the Sun in the
          same west-to-east direction as the Sun moves around the
          Zodiac.</p>
        <p>When we draw our view from Earth of Venus's orbit around
          the Sun, notice that its projection on the sky changes shape
          during the course of the year.  In fact, the orbit remains
          in a fixed orientation relative to the stars, which is
          slightly tilted from the ecliptic.  The apparent changes in
          shape exactly repeat every year as the Earth returns to the
          same vantage point.  For example, early in December when the
          Sun passes the brightest knot of the Milky Way, the Earth
          crosses the plane of Venus's orbit, and the orbit appears to
          collapse into a line.  This crossing happens at the same
          time every year, so you can see that Venus's orbit is fixed
          relative to the stars.  (This isn't quite true.  If you go
          to a date several thousand years in the past, you will
          notice that Venus's orbit - and Earth's orbit too - do
          change very slowly.)</p>
        <h3><a id="venus2-section" href="#venus2-section"
               onclick="setDialogTo('venus2')">
            Venus's orbit viewed from deep space</a></h3>
        <p>Orbits are imaginary paths the planets follow, and you need
          to imagine them as three dimensional curves, not just their
          projections onto the sky.  The best vantage point is far
          above the plane of the ecliptic, where you can see they are
          very nearly circles.  From this vantage point, a second
          orbit becomes visible - the path the Sun follows around the
          Earth.  Yes, we all learn that the Earth "really" goes
          around the Sun, but there isn't any geometrical reason we
          can't draw that orbit with the Earth at the center: Each
          point on the Sun's orbit lies in the direction we observe
          the Sun, at the distance of the Sun.</p>
        <p>When you draw this orbit of the Sun around Earth, it
          doesn't change the fact that Venus orbits the Sun.  Hence
          you very naturally arrive at a picture in which the center
          of Venus's orbit orbits around the Earth.  The ancient
          Greeks called what we call Venus's "orbit" its "epicycle".
          The center of the epicycle follows a path they called the
          "deferent", but which we've described as the "Sun's
          orbit".<p>
        </p>The picture you are looking at here is, qualitatively at
          least, the picture Hipparchus and the other great
          astronomers of ancient Greece used to think about how Venus
          moves.  It is the picture in the Almagest, which was the
          starting point for the great Islamic astronomers of the
          middle ages as well.</p>
        <h3><a id="venus3-section" href="#venus3-section"
               onclick="setDialogTo('venus3')">
            Venus's heliocentric orbit</a></h3>
        <p>Here are the orbits of Venus and Earth the way we were all
          taught in school.  On the plus side, we draw the two orbits
          with only a single center - the Sun.  On the minus side, when
          we picture the Earth moving around the Sun, it's much harder
          to visualize how the Earth-Venus line is changing - but that
          direction is where we actually see Venus in the sky!  From
          our point of view on Earth, Venus oscillates from one side
          of the Sun to the other as the Sun moves around the Zodiac
          - which is exactly what the epicycle picture of the two
          orbits shows.  It's not hard to understand why the ancient
          astronomers might prefer this more direct description of
          what we actually see to the modest simplification of a
          single center.</p>
        <p>You should check and uncheck the "sun center" box several
          times to be sure you understand the relationship between
          the heliocentric and geocentric pictures of the motion of
          Venus.  The relative positions of the three objects - Venus,
          Earth, and Sun - are exactly the same in both models.  The
          orbit of Venus is exactly the same.  The orbit of the Sun
          in the geocentric picture is exactly the same shape as the
          orbit of Earth in the heliocentric picture, but rotated
          180 degrees to swap the centers.</p>
